            <h1>Traveling Improves Your Health</h1>
            <p class="center">From cutting down on stress,
                to lowering your chances of developing a heart disease,
                 the health benefits of traveling are huge. 
               You may stay sitting on a chair all day long at the workplace: 
               including some walking to your trip is sure to make your body feel better.</p>

            <h1>Traveling Lets You Disconnect From Your Daily Life</h1>
            <p class="center"> This is closely related to my previous point.
                 We tend to get so caught up in our daily lives 
                 that sometimes, by simply sticking around, 
                 we may do ourselves more harm
                than good. Your boss is taking over your life? 
                Kids are driving you mad? Your parents are trying to make you 
                live the life they want? How long do you think you can 
                handle this pressure before you burst and everything falls
                 apart?

            <h1>Final Words On the Benefits of Traveling</h1>
            <p class="center"> “The magic thing about home is that it feels good 
                to leave, and it feels even better to come back”.
                 You will truly understand the meaning of those 
                 words by Wendy Wunder, only upon your return home.
                  On the one hand, it would seem that you’re back
                   where you started, same setting, same people,
                    same problems. Yet you’re not the same - you’re
                     new, full of new knowledge and ideas!
